Task 6 â€“ Sales Trend Analysis Using SQL
ðŸ“Œ Objective

The objective of this task is to analyze monthly revenue and order volume from an online_sales dataset using SQL. This helps identify business growth patterns, seasonal demand, and top-performing months.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

SQL (MSSQL/T-SQL)

Dataset: Online_Sales_Data table (with columns: ORDERNUMBER, ORDERDATE, SALES , PRODUCTCODE)

ðŸ“‚ Steps Performed

Data Import â€“ Loaded the dataset into the SQL database.

Date Extraction â€“ Used SQL date functions BY EXCTRACTING (YEAR(), MONTH()) from ORDERDATE to separate year and month.

Revenue Calculation â€“ Applied SUM(SALES) to calculate monthly revenue.

Order Volume Calculation â€“ Used COUNT(DISTINCT ORDERNUMBER) to find monthly order counts.

Grouping â€“ Grouped results by year and month.

Sorting â€“ Ordered results chronologically (ORDER BY year, month).

Top Months â€“ Retrieved top 3 months by revenue using ORDER BY revenue DESC LIMIT 3.

Learning Outcomes

Using aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT) in SQL.

Difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(DISTINCT col).

Grouping data by year/month for trend analysis.

Applying ORDER BY to sort results.

Identifying top-performing months with LIMIT.
